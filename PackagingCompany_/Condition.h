// Packages:
//*Use the Package inheritance hierarchy created in Lecture
//“Inheritance” to create a program that displays the address
//information and calculates the shipping costs for several
//Packages.
//The program should contain a vector of Package pointers to
//objects of classes TwoDayPackage and OvernightPackage.
//Loop through the vector to process the Packages
//polymorphically.
//For each Package, invoke get functions to obtain the
//address information of the sender and the recipient, then
//print the two addresses as they would appear on mailing
//labels.
//Also, call each Package's calculateCost member function
//and print the result.
//Keep track of the total shipping cost for all Packages in the
//vector, and display this total when the loop terminates.*/
