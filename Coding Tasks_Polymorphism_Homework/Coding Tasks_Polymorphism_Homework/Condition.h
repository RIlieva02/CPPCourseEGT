// Polymorphism:
// Implement a function printArea() that takes a pointer to the base
// class Shape as an argument and calls a method area() that should be defined in both
// derived classes Circle and Rectangle. The area() method should return the area of
// the shape, assuming Circle has an attribute radius and Rectangle has width and
// height.
