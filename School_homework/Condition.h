//a set of teachers. Each teacher teaches a set of disciplines. Students have name
//and unique class number. Classes have unique text identifier. Teachers have name
//and title. Disciplines have name, number of lectures and number of exercises.
// Define C++ classes for the school (School, Class, Student, Teacher, Discipline).
//Keep the member fields private. Add constructors and accessor methods. Write a
//testing class to construct and print a sample school.
